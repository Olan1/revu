From the pop-up modal, the home option was selected. The map was observed for the correct colour change, the board was observed for the bubble appearing in the correct board with the correct contents and colour. The charts were observed for updating correctly.","","The same country was clicked and the next option was selected. The colour change was observed on the map. On the board, it was checked that the bubble had moved to the correct section, changed to the expected colour, and still contained the correct content.","","This was repeated on the same country for all modal options. The same country was then selected and the home option was clicked on the modal. Another country was then clicked and the home option was selected on the modal. The map was observed to check that only the most recently selected home country had a green fill. The other was observed to have a gold fill.","","On the board section, when multiple home countries were selected, it was observed that only one bubble appeared in green in the home section. This bubble contained the correct content, displaying the most recently selected home countries name.","This was repeated for all countries.","","To test the reset map modal option, multiple countries were selected on the map with different modal options for each. The reset map modal option was clicked. The map was observed to ensure all countries had a gold fill. The board was observed to ensure no bubbles were displaying under each board heading. The charts were observed to display the correct info. This was repeated several times with different country and modal option selection combinations, including with every country selected.","","The pop-up modal was tested for closing after clicking the X icon, the close modal button, by clicking outside of the modal, and on click of every modal option.","","Testing was carried out by myself and several friends, who followed the above testing structure, each taking a single continent. Once testing was completed, I asked them to try to break the site. They failed.","","An issue found during testing was the map zoom and render location before and after clicking. If a region was selected while zoomed in, the map renders a new map fully zoomed out. I have been unsuccessful in fixing this issue and have unfortunately run out of time allocated for this project.","","## Deployment","Github was used for version control.","","This site is hosted on GitHub.
